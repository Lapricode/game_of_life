Game of life simulator

This is a game of life simulator. If you do not know what game of life is check out this article from wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life. During program execution there are many explanatory comments (written in greek and english) to help you navigate the simulation. There is one additional feature that I want to add, but the simulator is still fully functional without it.

Python libraries needed: random, math, os, turtle, tkinter
